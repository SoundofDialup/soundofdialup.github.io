description: How to fix some common hardware and software issues encountered while livestreaming.
---

This is a running record of some issues I've managed to solve that stemmed from using software and hardware for livestreaming. Please note that I only update solutions if I continue to encounter the same problem. Oftentimes issues reoccur a few times - to be irritating enough that I feel it necessary to document the fix -, and then I never have to deal with them again.

## Software issues

### Can't hear audio for sources played in OBS

> Solution working as of **January, 2021**

ðŸ‘‰ **In OBS**

1. Go to `Settings > Audio`
2. Scroll down to `Advanced`
3. Choose the Monitoring Device (e.g. Sample (TC-Helicon GoXLR Mini))

ðŸ‘‰ **In Windows Volume Mixer**

1. Select the same monitoring audio channel from _Step 3_ above.
2. Check the volume of OBS (it's probably muted!)
3. If that doesn't work, restart OBS and repeat the above.

## Hardware issues

### Can't connect Stream Deck to OBS

> Solution working as of **January, 2021**

1. Delete `StreamDeckPlugin.dll` and `StreamDeckPlugin.pdb`

   ```bash

3. Run the installer file.
