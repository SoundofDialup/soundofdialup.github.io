description: How to change the current user and computer name displayed in Git Bash for Windows.

Instead of showing the current user and computer name in the git bash prompt, we can change it to whatever we like.

Git Bash prompt before:

Git Bash prompt after:

## Instructions

1. Open **C:\Program Files\Git\etc\profile.d\git-prompt.sh** (or wherever you installed Git) in your favourite text editor (e.g. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/))
2. On line **15**, replace the entire line with: `PS1="$PS1"'Git '` (or even just ðŸ‘‰ `PS1="$PS1"''` if you don't want any text at all)
3. Save the file and restart Git Bash.
