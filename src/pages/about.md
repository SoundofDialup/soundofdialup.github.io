The unmistakeable sound of a 14.4k baud dialup modem was the song of my people, as the kids might say. I grew up in a time when 'visiting an internet website' was a novelty and index cards were king. Anyone with a hunger for knowledge frequented their local library, and most likely owned the entire collection of Encyclopedia Britannica, which sat atop the mantle piece because it was the only shelf strong enough to hold all that weight. (They were also great for boosting you up to that hard-to-reach top-of-the-wardrobe perch where Xmas gifts were often hidden.)

And then along came Tim Berners-Lee to change the world as we knew it. However, not everyone could afford 'a personal computer', and everything ~~was~~ is so much slower and more expensive in Australia if you wanted to get onto the information super highway. But there I was, one of the early nerds finding their way into message boards and building css-less web pages to be hosted on Geocities.

Life after that took me away from web design for a time - in favour of helping others expand their minds as much as I enjoyed expanding mine -, but here we are, returning to those nerdy roots a few decades later. A lot has changed ... and there's **significantly** more to learn than there once was, but I'm having an absolute ball (re)embracing my nerd status and hope you will, too!
